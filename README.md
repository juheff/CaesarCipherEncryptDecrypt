# CaesarCipherEncryptDecrypt

CaesarCipherEncryptDecrypt is a Python project that implements the Caesar cipher algorithm for text encryption and decryption. This simple program allows users to input a message and a shift value, and it performs encryption and decryption accordingly.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for inputting messages and shift values.
- Encryption and decryption functions using the classic Caesar cipher algorithm.
- Basic yet effective method for securing textual information.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `CaesarCipherEncryptDecrypt.py` script.
3. Enter a message and a shift value as prompted.
4. The program will display the encrypted and decrypted messages.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and run the Python script. It provides a practical introduction to basic encryption techniques in Python.
